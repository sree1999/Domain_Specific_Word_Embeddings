# Jiffy_NLP
Collaborated in a group of four to build domain-specific word embeddings for business/financial domains.

Built a corpus by scraping Wikipedia and Investopedia using Scrapy and Beautiful Soup.

Implemented Word2Vec on the corpus of words using the Gensim module. 

Developed an interactive Helper module, to aid developers in the task of finding appropriate functions from financial libraries available in Python. 

The Helper module i) identifies a given prompt and suggest a list of functions that are related to it, ii) retrieves the syntax and details of any function on the list (on request), iii) Has the option to copy the syntax for a selected function to clipboard.
